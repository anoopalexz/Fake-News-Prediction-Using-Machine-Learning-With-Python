This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict whether news articles are fake or real.
# Fake News Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a given news article is real or fake using machine learning techniques. A logistic regression model is trained on a dataset of labeled news articles to make predictions.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
- **src**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **README.md**: Project documentation providing an overview and basic instructions.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anoopalexz/fake-news-prediction.git
   cd fake-news-prediction
